# Styling Guide

## Universal Rules

### Variables

Variable names should be clear, short, and concise. Another team member should be able to understand what a declared variable holds with no description

### Spacing

All tabs across all files should be 4 spaces long, no matter the language. Please ensure that your VS Code has tabs set to 4 spaces. You can check this in Code > Settings > Editor: Tab Size

### Comments

- Comments are necessary, but do not clutter your code with comments either
- More details on comments later on

### Bracing

All uses of braces ("{" and "}") will use the Allman brace style (in other words, each brace will have its own line)

## HTML 

### Naming Conventions

Class names and ID names should be written using kebab case, where every letter is in lower case and words are separated with hyphens (ex: "my class" would be written as "my-class")

### Tags

- Starting ending tags for structural elements (`div`, `form`, `p`, etc) must be on the same indentation
- Text editing tags (`b`, `h1`, etc) must be open and closed on the same line of code (only break this rule if absolutely necessary)
- List elements such as `ol` and `ul` should have all their items written on the same indentation line
- Tags should all be in lowercase, no uppercase should be used at all (ex: use `<p>` and `</p>`, not `<P>` or `</P>`). This same rule applies to attributes as well (ex: use "href" not "HREF")
- Void elements such as `br` and `img` should be on their own line at the appropriate indentation
- Do not overuse divs!

### Spacing and Indentation

- Keep exactly 1 empty line between structural elements (`div`, `form`, etc)
- There should be no random spacing between elements, everything should be kept together
- Everything *inside* of a structural element should be indented so that it's clear what is inside and outside of it

### Comments

The only comments on files should be the ones at the top of each structural elements describing what it holds, what it will let the user do (if applicable), etc

### Example

Here is an example implementing all of these rules

```html
<!--This div holds a paragraph for my favorite kind of cookies-->
<div class = "chocolate-chip-cookies">
    <p>
        My favorite cookies are chocolate chip cookies!
    </p>    
    <br>
    <p>
        I also like oatmeal raisin cookies as well! Here are some other desserts I like: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Chocolate Cake</li>
        <li>Vanilla Ice Cream</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<!--This div holds a paragraph for my most hated desserts!-->
<div class = "chocolate-chip-cookie-hater">
    <p>
        I HATE chocolate chip cookies! 
    </p>    
    <br>
    <p>
        I <b>hate</b> oatmeal raisin cookies as well! Here are some other desserts I <i>HATE</i>: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>NOT Chocolate Cake</li>
        <li>NOT Vanilla Ice Cream</li>
    </ol>
</div>
```

## CSS 

### Naming Conventions

All selector name should be exactly the same as how they were written in the HTML file

### Selectors

- All selectors must contain a comment at the top using `/* */` describing what it's editing
- Group the edits inside each selectors by categories such as the following: text, size, color, etc (add a comment for each category describing where one list starts and the other ends, see the example below)
- Group all selectors by which sections of the page they apply to (ex: a button's styler and hover selectors should be grouped together)
- Order these groups **by the order in which they appear on the page**, see below for an example

### Colors

Try to use hex for all color representations. Only use other notations if absolutely necessary

### Spacing and Indentation

- Selectors should be separated by exactly 1 empty line
- Grouped selectors will be separated by exactly 3 empty lines
- When editing specific elements, there should be exactly 1 space following the ":" character

### Example

The following selectors edit the HTML shown in the previous section

```css
/*chocolate-chip-cookies class*/
.chocolate-chip-cookies
{
    /*Coloring*/
    color: #ad7139;

    /*Text*/ 
    text-size: 15px; 
    font-family: Arial;
}

/*chocolate-chip-cookies-hater class (NOTE THAT THIS IS SEPARATED BY 1 EMPTY LINE)*/
.chocolate-chip-cookies-hater
{
     /*Coloring*/
    color: #ffffff;

    /*Text*/ 
    text-size: 20px; 
    font-family: Arial;
}

/*Whatever follows chocolate-chip-cookies-hater on the website will be written below this comment (NOTE THAT THIS IS SEPARATED BY 3 EMPTY LINES)*/
```

## Javascript

### Naming Conventions

- All declared variables should be written using camel case notation, only the first word starts with a lower case and all following words start with an uppercase (ex: the "add two numbers" function would be written as "addTwoNumbers")
- This applies to both variables and function names

### Functions

- Functions should start with a descriptive, in-detail javadoc comment describing what the function takes in, what it returns, what the functions accomplishes, etc
- Functions should be separated by exactly 1 empty line between each other

### Variables

- Declare variables before use. This allows other developers to quickly locate what the variable holds and how it is changed in the following lines of code
- Avoid using "var" and use "let" instead

### Example

The following shows an example of all these style guides. Note that the two functions are separated by 1 empty line:

```jsx
/**
 * Takes in two numbers and returns the sum of both numbers
 * @param {int} firstNum The first integer that will be added
 * @param {int} secondNum The second integer that will be added 
 * @return {int} The sum of both numbers 
 */
function addTwoNumbers(firstNum, secondNum)
{
    let sum = 0; 
    sum = firstNum + secondNum; 
    return sum;
}

/**
 * Takes in two numbers and returns the difference of both numbers
 * @param {int} firstNum The initial value of the equation
 * @param {int} secondNum How much we are going to subtract from firstNum 
 * @return {int} The difference of both numbers 
 */
function subtractTwoNumbers(firstNum, secondNum)
{
    let difference = 0; 
    difference = firstNum - secondNum; 
    return difference;
}
```
